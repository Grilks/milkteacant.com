# Milk Tea Can't

## Written by Alan Forsyth

As soon as you discover Fraser walking backward and barefoot on the Meadows, Edinburgh Castle splashed by Hogmanay fireworks, you will be hooked.

You will be further compelled when you find out Edinburgh is a character in the novel, her worried eye on Fraser that ominous night.

Allow yourself to be both warmed and appalled with the characters you will meet, all in some way dealing with core human concerns that resonate with us all.

Taking place in such a charming location, this is a book that celebrates the spirit of the city and its people whilst exposing the underbelly that can destroy all of us.

“Wow. This is heavy-hitting stuff. There is gold in here.” Dane Picken, Screen Writer & Filmmaker, Australia.

This is a book that will generate important conversations.

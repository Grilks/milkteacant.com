As soon as you discover Fraser walking backward and barefoot on the Meadows, Edinburgh Castle splashed by Hogmanay fireworks, you will be hooked.

You will be further compelled when you find out Edinburgh is a character in the novel, her worried eye on Fraser that ominous night.

Allow yourself to be both warmed and appalled with the characters you will meet, all in some way dealing with core human concerns that resonate with us all.

Taking place in such a charming location, this is a book that celebrates the spirit of the city and its people whilst exposing the underbelly that can destroy all of us.

> "Wow. This is heavy-hitting stuff. There is gold in here."
> Dane Picken, Screen Writer & Filmmaker, Australia.

This is a book that will generate important conversations.

## What The Readers Say

"I am up to chapter 16 and I am relly enjoying it.  Good read, thanks." Louise Smith, Beaconsfield Australia.

"This is set to be a best seller." Helen McLucas, Sydney Australia.

"I found this book to be thought provoking and compelling.  Through the main character Fraser and set in the background of Edinburgh, the story touches on many human concerns; relationships, mental health, religion, sexuality, the dark side of the web and homelessness.  As the story unfolds and the characters develop, it reminds us of the weaknesses, strengths and vulnerability in all of us.  An excellent read.
***** rating.

## What's in it for you, the reader?  Three reasons why  Milk Tea Can't is a must read.

1. Becasue each of the characters exemplify core concerns that exist in our communities such as dysfunction in their families, lost identity, addiction, homelessness and suicide balanced carefully against love, hope and strength, readers resonate with these characters and their experiences. They become real to them.

2. Set in one of the most beautiful cities of the world, the reader is treated to a  cultural tour of Edinburgh. This of course includes its seedy side and several insights as to the historical development of Auld Reeky.

3. Alan Forsyth is a highlly creative author willing to explore what is new and different.  In Milk Tea Can't he uniquely includes Edinburgh as a character,  observing and commentating on the events and characters in the novel and of course on her own city. Perhaps she a cross between a Shakesperean chorus and a contemporary influencer.

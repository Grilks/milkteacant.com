> "I found this book to be thought provoking and compelling. Through the main character Fraser and set in the background of Edinburgh, the story touches on many human concerns; relationships, mental health, religion, sexuality, the dark side of the web and homelessness. As the story unfolds and the characters develop, it reminds us of the weaknesses, strengths and vulnerability in all of us. An excellent read.
> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating
> Yvonne Junor, Melbourne Australia.

> An intriguing and captivating story of a dysfunctional family. Couldn’t put it down. I really enjoyed the book. Alan slowly draws you into the web of a dysfunctional family as introduced by the city of Edinburgh in each chapter. Each of the family members’ history, character, interrelations, and interactions with others are revealed until you cannot put the book down as the crescendo builds into a number of climatic and life-changing outcomes for each one. Some of the characters will appall, some will inspire, and some will resonate with you as the story unfolds and life choices are made where getting ‘back on the rails and off the rails’ are explored. The plethora of human possibilities are presented to the reader to captivate and draw you in. A powerful read.

> Max, Melbourne Australia.

> Reading this novel felt like an immersion in the maelstrom of life in Edinburgh city. The characters, the cultural norms, even the language are brought to the fore as we explore the dysfunctional lives of a some of the city’s residents. In walking the path with these wee folk, we gain insights into the day to day suffering that we humans can inhabit, our inability to see past our own stuff- wants, craving, desires and addictions. On occasions we see the sun shine with new possibilities, only to revisit the grey wet blanket of despair. We ride the waves with these Edinburgh folk as they try to pay attention to what is most important in their lives. We, as readers, are invited to reflect on our own lives and the ever present possibility of happiness from within and with each other. A novel to perturb the spirit.

## What's in it for you, the reader?

{% Subtitle %}Three reasons why Milk Tea Can't is a must read.{% endSubtitle %}

1. Becasue each of the characters exemplify core concerns that exist in our communities such as dysfunction in their families, lost identity, addiction, homelessness and suicide balanced carefully against love, hope and strength, readers resonate with these characters and their experiences. They become real to them.
2. Set in one of the most beautiful cities of the world, the reader is treated to a cultural tour of Edinburgh. This of course includes its seedy side and several insights as to the historical development of Auld Reeky.
3. Alan Forsyth is a highlly creative author willing to explore what is new and different. In Milk Tea Can't he uniquely includes Edinburgh as a character, observing and commentating on the events and characters in the novel and of course on her own city. Perhaps she a cross between a Shakesperean chorus and a contemporary influencer.

As soon as you discover Fraser walking backward and barefoot on the Meadows, Edinburgh Castle splashed by Hogmanay fireworks, you will be hooked.

You will be further compelled when you find out Edinburgh is a character in the novel, her worried eye on Fraser that ominous night.

Allow yourself to be both warmed and appalled with the characters you will meet, all in some way dealing with core human concerns that resonate with us all.

Taking place in such a charming location, this is a book that celebrates the spirit of the city and its people whilst exposing the underbelly that can destroy all of us.

> "Wow. This is heavy-hitting stuff. There is gold in here."
> Dane Picken, Screen Writer & Filmmaker, Australia.

This is a book that will generate important conversations.

## About the Author

Alans's early career included supporting large corporations, like Yellow Pages Australia and Simplot, where he encouraged teams and managers to improve their performance which flowed onto them becoming better people, teams and leaders.

His acumen in helping people transform was also applied in small business, learning institutions and charities and it was not unusual to see him out on the streets supporting young homeless people and helping young leaders to be better leaders.

In recent years, Alan has been entertaining a growing number of subscribers in his More Than a Blog segment on his website, [followingforsyth.com](https://followingforsyth.com). A student of literature, he was praised as a teacher of English to senior students at the prestigious Korowa Anglican Girls School, in Melbourne Australia.

Alan is celebrated as a leader in community and charity, more recently founding and chairing the Men of Leith Men’s Shed, a vital charity in Leith Scotland. He also has a strong academic background with a flair for turning ideas into action. His undergraduate qualifications in psychology combined with extensive postgraduate qualifications in organisational change, ontology and mindfulness provide a rich background to his pursuits as a writer and speaker.

He recently returned to Melbourne, Australia following five years in Scotland. Having completed his second book, Milk Tea Can’t, he will continue to enjoy writing, travelling with his wife and performing with choirs. He will of course continue to provide direct help to charities.
